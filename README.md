=======================================================================

This repository contains the source code of analyses contained within my 
manuscript with Wayne Linklater, Werner Kilian, Pierre du Preez, and Wayne M. Getz, 
submitted for consideration to Movement Ecology's BioMove Special Edition in
May 2019. Revisions were completed in July 2019, introducing small changes to
the 24-hr displacement estimation and adding several new supplementary analyses.

## A note on data availability
This repository includes cleaned analysis scripts but no associated data and is
therefore *not* completely reproducible. The datasets generated and/or analyzed 
during this study are not publicly available in order to protect the locations 
and resources of a critically endangered species but may be made privately 
available by me, the corresponding author, on reasonable request. The MODIS 
imagery analyzed is freely available from [NASA](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php).
